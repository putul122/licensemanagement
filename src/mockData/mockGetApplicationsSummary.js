          'description': 'Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) is a protocol used by GSM cellular telephones (mobile phones) to communicate with the service providers computers operator. A USSD Gateway routes USSD messages from the signaling network to a service application and back.A gateway is the hardware and software required to connect networks and perform protocol conversion. It routes USSD messages to and from the signaling network. It complements SMS services, bringing faster messaging to users. Unlike SMS and MMS, which store and forward messages independently of the session, USSD establishes a single, real time session between the handset and the application.Operators can introduce messaging services with USSD as the bearer, enabling faster response times. USSD has massive potential to deliver new services in developing markets as it has a low barrier to entry and is intuitive, menu-driven and works with all handsets. USSD is mainly used for banking and airtime recharging. Other applications include: Voice chat, roaming (home network routing), menu driven navigation, voting, competitions, CallMe, information (weather, traffic etc.), entertainment (games, sports etc.), lifestyle (dating, horoscopes etc.), social networking etc Note: Solution previously provided by Cornastone but not anymore.',
